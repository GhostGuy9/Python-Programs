If you {answers[0]} want to {answers[1]} about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was {answers[2]},
and what my {answers[3]} childhood was like, and how my {answers[4]} were occupied and all before they had me,
and all that {answers[5]} kind of {answers[6]}, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to {answers[7]} the {answers[8]}.
In the first place, that stuff {answers[9]} me, and in the second place, my {answers[10]} would have about {answers[11]} {answers[12]}
apiece if I told anything pretty {answers[13]} about them.
They're quite {answers[14]} about anything like that, especially my {answers[15]}.
